Oolite German
German Localization Oolite eXpansion Pack V0.3

Introduction:
-------------
This is the german localization expansion pack for Oolite. After installation, all written Texts are in german.
The descriptions of Planets are sometimes not perfect, due the system behind was made for english, but many people develop this game further and some day they present a new multilingual system.


Requirements:
-------------
Oolite v1.71.1 or later.
200 KB of free space and space for the saved games.


Installation:
-------------
Unzip the file into a temporary folder and move the OXP into the "AddOns" folder.
Like ".../Oolite (v1.72.2.1)/Oolite/AddOns/OoliteGerman_V0.3.oxp"
Start the game while pressing the "Shift"-Key, this forces the game to rebuild all cache with the addons. 


Known Problems:
---------------
1) If you open a saved game, the game starts, but the oxp's are not loaded.
Cache refresh with Shift is meant to work only on game startup, not when you load a saved game.

2) OXP's can overdrive other OXP's. This localization expansion pack covers only the game itself with no other OXP.
And of course, just use one localization expansion pack.



Reporting problems:
-------------------
If you discover bugs, problems or have a proposal or recommendation with regards to this OXP, please let us know. You can use the Oolite Bulettin Boards at www.aegidian.org/bb for reporting.


Thanks and acknowledgments:
---------------------------
This translation based on the Italian expansion pack, they solved most of the problems so I could easy translate it to german, except the descriptions of Planets was difficult.

Many thanks go to:
 - Ahruman, for implementing 8-bit encoding support in Oolite, making all this a possibility.
 - Commander McLane for pointing out many of the technical difficulties involved in producing a localized modification and proposing solutions, many of which ended up in the main game engine.

And another_commander for the help on the board and being the first translator and pave the way for others.
